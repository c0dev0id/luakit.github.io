			<h2>Luakit Help</h2>

			<h3>How to ask for help</h3>

			<p>If you're having difficulty with any aspect of luakit, , please open an issue at
			the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/luakit/luakit/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>,
			and we'll be happy to help you!</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>This will require making a GitHub user account if you do not already have one.</p></li>
				<li><p>It's a good idea to search the issue tracker before asking, in case your
			question has already been asked and answered.</p></li>
			</ul>

            <p>The <code>#luakit</code> IRC channel is also a great place to ask
			questions; just join <code>#luakit</code> on the OFTC network, and ask
			your question. Don't worry if there's no immediate response; depending
			on time zones, the developers may be asleep!</p>

			<h3>How to report a bug</h3>

			<p>Please report any bugs or issues you find
			<a href="https://github.com/luakit/luakit/issues">here</a> on the luakit issue tracker.
			This will require making a GitHub user account if you do not already
			have one.</p>

			<p>Please search the issue tracker before opening a new issue; if someone
			has already reported the same issue, it's better to comment on that
			issue instead of opening a new one.</p>

			<p>Please include the following information in your bug report:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Current luakit version; this can be found by running <code>luakit --version</code> in the terminal.</p>
					<p>Example: <code>luakit 2012.09.13-r1-1722-gca2571be</code></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Current operating system, version, and CPU architecture, if applicable.</p>
					<p>Examples: "Ubuntu 16.04 on i386", "Arch 64-bit"</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If luakit was working recently but broke in an update, please also include
					the version number for the most recent known-working build.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How to request a new feature / make a suggestion</h3>

			<p>Feature requests can be made <a href="https://github.com/luakit/luakit/issues">here</a>
			on the luakit issue tracker. It's always a good idea to search before
			opening a new issue, in case anyone has already requested that feature
			or made a similar/related suggestion.</p>
